I selected Free VPN for Edge – VPN Proxy VeePN, a well-rated and widely used VPN extension available on the Microsoft Edge Add-ons Store. It allows basic VPN access without needing to create an account for the free version.

I opened Microsoft Edge, searched for “VeePN” in the Edge Add-ons Store, and installed the VeePN extension. After installation, the VPN icon appeared next to the address bar.

I clicked the VeePN icon, and from the list of available countries, I selected a nearby free server location. I then clicked the "Connect" button, and the extension established a secure VPN connection.

I visited https://whatismyipaddress.com before and after connecting to the VPN. I confirmed that my IP address changed from my real ISP-assigned IP to one belonging to the VPN server location.

While the VPN was connected, I browsed secure websites such as https://example.com and https://wikipedia.org. All connections were routed through the VPN tunnel, ensuring encrypted traffic and privacy from local network monitoring.

I disconnected the VPN from the VeePN extension and checked my IP again, which reverted to my original address. I also noticed that browsing speed slightly improved after disconnecting, as VPN routing typically adds a small amount of latency.

VeePN uses AES-256 encryption to secure data and supports multiple VPN protocols such as OpenVPN, IKEv2, and WireGuard (on full apps). The Edge extension, while more limited, still routes traffic securely. VeePN claims a no-logs policy, meaning it does not store browsing activity, ensuring basic privacy protection for users.
